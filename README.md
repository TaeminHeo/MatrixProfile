# Matrix Profile

This repository contains project outcomes conducted with David Chen (UT Austin) during Spring 2021.
We explored trends and anomalies in ocean data.
For the exploration, we studied Matrix Profile which identifies motifs (a repeated pattern in a time series) and discords (an anomaly).
